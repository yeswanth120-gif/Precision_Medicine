# Medical Tests and Procedures Guide

Q: What is an ejection fraction test and why is it important?
A: Ejection fraction (EF) is a measurement of how much blood the left ventricle pumps out with each heartbeat, expressed as a percentage. Normal EF is 55-70%. It's measured using echocardiography, cardiac MRI, or nuclear stress tests. Low EF (<40%) indicates heart failure or cardiomyopathy, while preserved EF (>50%) with symptoms suggests heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. This test helps diagnose heart conditions, guide treatment decisions, and monitor response to therapy.

Q: What do creatinine levels indicate about kidney function?
A: Serum creatinine is a waste product from muscle metabolism that's filtered by the kidneys. Normal levels are 0.6-1.2 mg/dL for men and 0.5-1.1 mg/dL for women. Elevated creatinine suggests reduced kidney function. It's used to calculate estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which stages kidney disease: Stage 1 (>90 ml/min/1.73mÂ²), Stage 2 (60-89), Stage 3 (30-59), Stage 4 (15-29), and Stage 5 (<15). Regular monitoring helps detect kidney disease early and guide treatment.

Q: What is HbA1c and how does it relate to diabetes?
A: HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) measures average blood sugar levels over 2-3 months by testing the percentage of hemoglobin with attached glucose. Normal is <5.7%, prediabetes is 5.7-6.4%, and diabetes is â¥6.5%. For people with diabetes, target is usually <7%. This test doesn't require fasting and provides better long-term glucose control assessment than single blood glucose measurements. It's used for diabetes diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment adjustment.

Q: What are genetic mutations and how do they affect lung cancer risk?
A: Genetic mutations are changes in DNA that can increase cancer risk or affect treatment response. Key lung cancer mutations include: EGFR (found in 10-15% of lung cancers, treatable with targeted therapy), KRAS (25-30% of cases, historically difficult to treat), ALK (3-5% of cases, responds well to ALK inhibitors), TP53 (50-70% of cases, indicates aggressive disease), and ROS1 (1-2% of cases, treatable with targeted drugs). Genetic testing helps personalize treatment and predict prognosis.

Q: What is blood pressure and what do the numbers mean?
A: Blood pressure measures the force of blood against artery walls during heartbeats. It's recorded as systolic/diastolic pressure in mmHg. Normal is <120/80, elevated is 120-129/<80, stage 1 hypertension is 130-139/80-89, stage 2 is â¥140/90, and hypertensive crisis is >180/120. Systolic (top number) measures pressure during heart contraction, diastolic (bottom number) during relaxation. High blood pressure damages arteries and increases heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease risk.

Q: What is BMI and how is it calculated?
A: Body Mass Index (BMI) is calculated as weight (kg) divided by height (m) squared, or weight (lbs) Ã 703 divided by height (inches) squared. Categories are: Underweight (<18.5), Normal (18.5-24.9), Overweight (25-29.9), Obese Class I (30-34.9), Class II (35-39.9), and Class III (â¥40). While BMI doesn't distinguish between muscle and fat, it's a useful screening tool for weight-related health risks including diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers.

Q: What are troponin levels and when are they tested?
A: Troponin is a protein complex found in heart muscle that's released into blood when heart muscle is damaged. Normal levels are <0.04 ng/mL. Elevated troponin indicates heart muscle damage, most commonly from heart attack but also from other conditions like heart failure, myocarditis, or pulmonary embolism. Troponin levels are measured in emergency situations when heart attack is suspected, with peak levels occurring 12-24 hours after symptom onset.

Q: What is insulin and how does it work in the body?
A: Insulin is a hormone produced by pancreatic beta cells that regulates blood glucose levels. It allows cells to absorb glucose from blood for energy or storage. In Type 1 diabetes, the pancreas produces little or no insulin. In Type 2 diabetes, cells become resistant to insulin or the pancreas doesn't produce enough. Normal fasting insulin levels are 2-25 mIU/L. Insulin resistance, measured by HOMA-IR, precedes Type 2 diabetes development by years.

Q: What are normal platelet counts and what do abnormal levels indicate?
A: Normal platelet count is 150,000-450,000 platelets per microliter. Thrombocytopenia (low platelets <150,000) can cause easy bruising and bleeding, while thrombocytosis (high platelets >450,000) may increase clotting risk. In heart disease, very low platelets might indicate bleeding risk from anticoagulant medications, while very high counts could increase heart attack or stroke risk. Platelet function is also important for cardiovascular health.

Q: What is serum sodium and why is it important?
A: Serum sodium measures sodium concentration in blood, normally 135-145 mEq/L. Hyponatremia (low sodium <135) can cause confusion, seizures, and coma, often from heart failure, kidney disease, or medication side effects. Hypernatremia (high sodium >145) causes thirst, confusion, and dehydration, usually from inadequate fluid intake or excessive losses. In heart failure, low sodium often indicates more severe disease and poorer prognosis.

Q: What are white blood cells and what do counts indicate?
A: White blood cells (WBCs) are immune system cells that fight infection. Normal count is 4,000-11,000 cells/mmÂ³. Elevated WBC (leukocytosis) may indicate infection, inflammation, stress, or blood cancers. Low WBC (leukopenia) suggests weakened immune system from medications, autoimmune diseases, or bone marrow problems. In kidney disease, WBC counts help assess infection risk and overall health status.

Q: What is blood glucose and what are normal levels?
A: Blood glucose measures sugar concentration in blood. Normal fasting levels are 70-99 mg/dL, prediabetes is 100-125 mg/dL, and diabetes is â¥126 mg/dL. Random glucose â¥200 mg/dL suggests diabetes. Post-meal glucose should be <140 mg/dL at 2 hours. Continuous glucose monitoring provides detailed glucose patterns. High glucose damages blood vessels and organs, while low glucose can cause confusion, seizures, and coma.

Q: What is blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and what does it indicate?
A: BUN measures urea nitrogen in blood, a waste product from protein metabolism filtered by kidneys. Normal levels are 7-20 mg/dL. Elevated BUN suggests kidney dysfunction, dehydration, high protein intake, or increased protein breakdown. Low BUN may indicate liver disease, malnutrition, or overhydration. BUN is often evaluated with creatinine; BUN/creatinine ratio helps distinguish kidney problems from other causes of elevated BUN.
