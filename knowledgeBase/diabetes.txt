Q: What is diabetes and how does it affect the body?
A: Diabetes is a chronic condition where the body cannot effectively use insulin to regulate blood sugar (glucose) levels. When you eat, your body breaks down food into glucose, which cells use for energy. Insulin, produced by the pancreas, helps glucose enter cells. In diabetes, either the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin or the body doesn't respond to insulin properly, leading to high blood glucose levels. Over time, high blood sugar damages blood vessels, nerves, and organs throughout the body.

Q: What are the different types of diabetes?
A: The main types are: Type 1 Diabetes - an autoimmune condition where the body attacks insulin-producing cells, usually diagnosed in childhood or young adults, requires insulin therapy; Type 2 Diabetes - the most common form where the body doesn't use insulin effectively, often develops in adults, may be managed with lifestyle changes and medications; Gestational Diabetes - develops during pregnancy, usually resolves after delivery but increases risk of Type 2 diabetes later; and Prediabetes - blood sugar levels higher than normal but not high enough for Type 2 diabetes diagnosis.

Q: What are the symptoms of diabetes?
A: Common symptoms include: Frequent urination (polyuria), Excessive thirst (polydipsia), Unexplained weight loss, Extreme fatigue, Blurred vision, Slow-healing wounds, Frequent infections, Tingling or numbness in hands or feet, and Increased hunger. Type 1 symptoms often appear suddenly and severely, while Type 2 symptoms develop gradually and may be mild initially. Many people with Type 2 diabetes have no symptoms for years, making regular screening important.

Q: What causes diabetes and what are the risk factors?
A: Type 1 diabetes is caused by autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing cells, with genetic and environmental factors playing a role. Type 2 diabetes risk factors include: Age over 45, Family history of diabetes, Being overweight or obese, Physical inactivity, Race/ethnicity (higher risk in African American, Hispanic, Native American, Asian American populations), History of gestational diabetes, High blood pressure, Abnormal cholesterol levels, and Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Some risk factors can be modified through lifestyle changes.

Q: How is diabetes diagnosed?
A: Diabetes is diagnosed through blood tests: Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) - 126 mg/dL or higher indicates diabetes, Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) - 200 mg/dL or higher after 2 hours indicates diabetes, Random Plasma Glucose - 200 mg/dL or higher with symptoms indicates diabetes, and Hemoglobin A1C - 6.5% or higher indicates diabetes. Prediabetes is diagnosed with FPG 100-125 mg/dL, OGTT 140-199 mg/dL, or A1C 5.7-6.4%. Two abnormal test results on different days confirm the diagnosis.

Q: What is HbA1c and why is it important?
A: Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) measures average blood glucose levels over the past 2-3 months. It shows the percentage of red blood cells with glucose attached. Normal A1c is below 5.7%, prediabetes is 5.7-6.4%, and diabetes is 6.5% or higher. For people with diabetes, the goal is usually below 7%, though individual targets may vary. A1c testing is crucial for diagnosis, monitoring diabetes control, and adjusting treatment plans.

Q: What are the complications of diabetes?
A: Diabetes complications include: Cardiovascular disease (heart attack, stroke), Diabetic neuropathy (nerve damage causing pain, numbness), Diabetic retinopathy (eye damage potentially causing blindness), Diabetic nephropathy (kidney damage leading to kidney failure), Diabetic foot problems (ulcers, infections, potential amputation), Skin conditions and infections, Dental problems (gum disease), and Increased risk of other infections. Good diabetes management significantly reduces the risk of these complications.

Q: How does diabetes affect the cardiovascular system?
A: Diabetes significantly increases cardiovascular risk by: Damaging blood vessels and accelerating atherosclerosis, Increasing blood pressure and cholesterol levels, Promoting inflammation and blood clot formation, Damaging nerves that control heart function, and Increasing risk of heart attack and stroke by 2-4 times. People with diabetes should pay special attention to cardiovascular risk factors and may need more aggressive treatment of blood pressure and cholesterol.

Q: What is diabetic neuropathy?
A: Diabetic neuropathy is nerve damage caused by prolonged high blood sugar. Types include: Peripheral neuropathy - affects feet and hands, causing pain, tingling, numbness, or weakness; Autonomic neuropathy - affects nerves controlling internal organs, causing digestive problems, irregular heartbeat, or sexual dysfunction; Proximal neuropathy - affects nerves in thighs, hips, or buttocks; and Mononeuropathy - affects single nerves. Good blood sugar control can prevent or slow neuropathy progression.

Q: How does diabetes affect the eyes?
A: Diabetes can cause several eye problems: Diabetic retinopathy - damage to blood vessels in the retina, potentially leading to blindness; Diabetic macular edema - swelling in the central part of the retina; Cataracts - clouding of the eye lens, more common in people with diabetes; and Glaucoma - increased pressure in the eye. Regular eye exams are crucial for early detection and treatment. Good blood sugar control reduces the risk of diabetic eye disease.

Q: What is diabetic kidney disease?
A: Diabetic kidney disease (diabetic nephropathy) occurs when high blood sugar damages the kidneys' filtering system. It progresses through stages: Stage 1-2 - kidney damage with normal or high filtration rate; Stage 3 - moderate decrease in kidney function; Stage 4 - severe decrease in kidney function; Stage 5 - kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplant. Early detection through urine and blood tests allows for treatment to slow progression. Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure.

Q: How is diabetes managed and treated?
A: Diabetes management involves: Blood sugar monitoring through fingerstick testing or continuous glucose monitors, Medication management (insulin, metformin, other diabetes medications), Healthy eating focused on carbohydrate counting and portion control, Regular physical activity, Weight management, Blood pressure and cholesterol control, Regular medical check-ups, and Diabetes education and support. Treatment plans are individualized based on type of diabetes, age, overall health, and personal preferences.

Q: What medications are used to treat diabetes?
A: Type 1 diabetes requires insulin therapy. Type 2 diabetes medications include: Metformin - first-line treatment that reduces glucose production, Sulfonylureas - stimulate insulin production, DPP-4 inhibitors - help control blood sugar after meals, GLP-1 receptor agonists - slow digestion and lower blood sugar, SGLT2 inhibitors - help kidneys remove glucose through urine, and Insulin - when other medications aren't sufficient. Medication choice depends on individual factors, side effects, and treatment goals.

Q: What should I eat if I have diabetes?
A: A healthy diabetes diet includes: Non-starchy vegetables (leafy greens, broccoli, peppers), Lean proteins (fish, poultry, beans, tofu), Whole grains (brown rice, quinoa, oats), Healthy fats (olive oil, nuts, avocados), Low-fat dairy products, and Limited refined sugars and processed foods. Focus on portion control, consistent meal timing, and carbohydrate counting. Work with a registered dietitian to create a personalized meal plan that fits your lifestyle and preferences.

Q: How does exercise help with diabetes?
A: Exercise benefits people with diabetes by: Improving insulin sensitivity, Lowering blood glucose levels, Reducing cardiovascular risk, Helping with weight management, Improving mood and energy, Strengthening muscles and bones, and Enhancing overall quality of life. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity weekly, plus muscle-strengthening activities twice weekly. Always check blood sugar before and after exercise, and carry glucose tablets in case of low blood sugar.

Q: What is hypoglycemia and how do I treat it?
A: Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) occurs when blood glucose drops below 70 mg/dL. Symptoms include shakiness, sweating, rapid heartbeat, dizziness, hunger, confusion, and irritability. Severe hypoglycemia can cause unconsciousness or seizures. Treatment follows the "15-15 rule": consume 15 grams of fast-acting carbohydrates, wait 15 minutes, then recheck blood sugar. If still low, repeat. Always carry glucose tablets, juice, or candy. Severe hypoglycemia requires emergency medical attention.

Q: How often should I check my blood sugar?
A: Blood sugar monitoring frequency depends on your diabetes type and treatment: Type 1 diabetes - typically 4-6 times daily (before meals, bedtime, and when symptoms occur), Type 2 diabetes on insulin - as directed by your healthcare provider, often 2-4 times daily, Type 2 diabetes on other medications - may check 1-2 times daily or as recommended, and During illness or stress - more frequent monitoring may be needed. Continuous glucose monitors provide real-time readings and trends.

Q: What is the dawn phenomenon?
A: The dawn phenomenon is a natural rise in blood sugar that occurs in the early morning hours (typically 4-8 AM) due to hormone releases that prepare the body for waking. This can cause higher fasting blood glucose levels. Management strategies include adjusting medication timing, changing evening snacks, exercising in the evening, or working with your healthcare provider to adjust insulin regimens. It's a normal physiological process that's more pronounced in people with diabetes.

Q: How can I prevent Type 2 diabetes?
A: Type 2 diabetes prevention strategies include: Maintaining healthy weight through balanced diet and regular exercise, Eating a diet rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins, Limiting processed foods, sugary drinks, and refined carbohydrates, Engaging in regular physical activity (at least 150 minutes weekly), Not smoking, Limiting alcohol consumption, Managing stress effectively, Getting adequate sleep (7-9 hours nightly), and Regular health screenings. Even modest weight loss (5-10% of body weight) can significantly reduce diabetes risk.

Q: What should I do if I'm diagnosed with prediabetes?
A: Prediabetes management focuses on preventing progression to Type 2 diabetes: Lose 5-10% of body weight through diet and exercise, Eat a healthy diet emphasizing whole foods and portion control, Exercise regularly (at least 150 minutes weekly), Monitor blood sugar as recommended, Attend regular medical check-ups, Consider diabetes prevention programs, Manage other health conditions (high blood pressure, high cholesterol), and Stay motivated with support from family, friends, or diabetes educators.

Q: How does stress affect blood sugar?
A: Stress can significantly impact blood sugar through: Release of stress hormones (cortisol, adrenaline) that raise blood glucose, Disruption of sleep patterns affecting blood sugar control, Changes in eating habits (stress eating or skipping meals), Reduced motivation for self-care activities, and Increased insulin resistance. Stress management techniques include regular exercise, meditation, deep breathing, adequate sleep, social support, and professional counseling when needed.

Q: What are the warning signs of diabetic emergencies?
A: Diabetic emergencies include: Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) - symptoms include fruity breath odor, rapid breathing, vomiting, confusion, extreme thirst; Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) - symptoms include severe dehydration, confusion, extreme thirst, high blood sugar; and Severe hypoglycemia - symptoms include confusion, seizures, unconsciousness. These are medical emergencies requiring immediate medical attention. People with diabetes should have emergency action plans and medical alert identification.

Q: How do I manage diabetes during illness?
A: Sick day management includes: Continue taking diabetes medications even if not eating well, Monitor blood sugar more frequently, Stay hydrated with sugar-free fluids, Eat easy-to-digest foods when possible, Check for ketones if blood sugar is high, Contact your healthcare provider for guidance on medication adjustments, Have someone check on you regularly, and Seek immediate medical care if you can't keep fluids down or blood sugar remains very high. Never stop taking insulin during illness.

Q: What role does sleep play in diabetes management?
A: Quality sleep is crucial for diabetes management. Poor sleep can: Increase insulin resistance, Raise blood sugar levels, Affect hormones that regulate hunger and appetite, Reduce motivation for healthy lifestyle choices, and Increase stress hormones. Sleep apnea is more common in people with diabetes and can worsen blood sugar control. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep nightly with consistent sleep schedule, comfortable sleep environment, and good sleep hygiene practices.
